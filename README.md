# TomYam
For NUS Hack&amp;Roll 2023

The following project is an adaption of a Flask web app tutorial:
https://github.com/techwithtim/Flask-Web-App-Tutorial

This project shall not be considered for judging due to the large similarity with the tutorial code base. It is created with the intention to learn the underlying technologies needed to build it, rather than an actual submission for judging.
